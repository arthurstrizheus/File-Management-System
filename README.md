# File-Management-System
This program allows you to choose a location where files you would like to be transferred from and to. After that, you can choose to rename each file within the program. The program allows you to create abbreviations at the beginning of your file name which is used to sort the files and place them into corresponding folders of your choice. The program sorts the files into the correct Year/Month/Week/Day folder. The folder the files are placed in is dependant on when it was created. If a file was created on 08/12/2020 then it would be placed in C:...\2020\August\Wendsday\FileName. The program automatically creates all necessary file paths when a new file path is needed. All this is packaged into a neat and simple GUI.
